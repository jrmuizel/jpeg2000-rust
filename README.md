# Rust bindings to OpenJPEG
This crate provides access to OpenJPEG's JPEG2000 decoder.

Please be advised that using C code means this crate is likely vulnerable to various memory exploits, e.g. see [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8332](CVE-2016-8332) for an actual example from the past.

As soon as someone writes an efficient JPEG2000 decoder in pure Rust you should probably switch over to that.
